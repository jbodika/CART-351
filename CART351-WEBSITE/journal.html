			<h4> WEEK 1</h4>
			<article> This first class was mostly about going over the course outline and expectations. We didn't dive
				into new material yet, but it helped to see what the semester would look like and what kinds of projects
				we'd be working on.</article>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h4> WEEK 2</h4>
			<article>This week we had an introduction to Python. We reviewed creating variables, doing basic math,
				formatting output, taking user input, writing functions (including callback functions), and using
				if/else statements. It covered a lot, but it felt manageable.
				<br>
				<br>
				I also learned about MiniConda, which is a tool for managing Python dependencies and creating isolated
				virtual environments. It seems really useful in theory, although I'm still not totally confident that
				I'm using it correctly yet. Since I already have some experience with Python, this class mostly felt
				like a refresher, which was nice.
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4> WEEK 3</h4>
			<article> This week we learned how to integrate web APIs into a Python project in order to manipulate and
				analyze data. I'd never used a weather API with Python before, so it was interesting to see how external
				data can be pulled in and worked with.
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4> WEEK 4</h4>
			<article> We were introduced to Flask, a Python framework used to create web applications. We ran our first
				web server and learned how to create dynamic pages by passing input between routes. Seeing Python work
				directly with a browser was really exciting and made things less static.</article>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4> WEEK 5</h4>
			<article>CANCELLED CLASS DUE TO STRIKE.</article>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4> WEEK 6</h4>
			<article>We continued exploring Flask and focused more on how it can be used creatively, not just
				functionally. It was helpful to see how flexible Flask is and how it can support more experimental or
				interactive ideas.</article>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h4> WEEK 7 </h4>
			<article> This week we kept working with Flask and Python, running web servers and creating dynamic pages
				with user input. Repeating these steps helped reinforce how routing and data passing actually work.
			</article>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4> WEEK 8 </h4>
			<article> We worked with JSON and form data using method arguments. I was already familiar with using JSON
				in projects, but it was useful to revisit it in the context of Flask. We also learned how to manipulate
				and store user data in JSON files, which feels very practical for smaller applications.</article>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4> WEEK 9</h4>
			<article> This week we had a lecture on MongoDB and how to integrate it into Flask applications. MongoDB is
				a schema-flexible database, and its interface feels pretty intuitive. We went through some examples,
				which really helped make sense of it. I liked that MongoDB allows you to create, read, update, and
				delete data in real time. </article>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4> WEEK 10 </h4>
			<article> Today's class was more interactive. We walked around the classroom reviewing each other's Flask
				projects. I really enjoy this format because we get feedback, talk through ideas, and see how everyone
				approaches the same assignment differently. It's also just fun to explore other people's projects. We
				also reviewed sockets for real-time user connections, which seems super useful for interactive
				applications.</article>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4> WEEK 11 </h4>
			<article>We continued working with MongoDB and focused on visualizing data on a web page. We were shown how
				MongoDB can be integrated with p5.js to create interesting visualizations. This made the data feel more
				expressive and creative rather than just functional. </article>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h4> WEEK 12 </h4>
			<article>This week we were assigned an exercise that took way longer than I expected. Coming up with three
				different visualizations that all showcased the same data was harder than I thought. Even though it was
				challenging, I think I managed to create something I actually like, which made the effort feel worth it.
